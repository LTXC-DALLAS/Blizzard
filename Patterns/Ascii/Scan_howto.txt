search for regular expression ^\*.*\* parses out just regular vectors.  No
comments or scan vectors.

To grep out just vectors from a_st_tk_fles_1_v22_DPM.uno and put them in
junk.txt:

grep '^\*.*\*' a_st_tk_fles_1_v22_DPM.uno > junk.txt

Open the text file in nedit and do a regular expression search/replace.  Search
for '.' & replace it with '&,'.  This will change the file into a csv file.
